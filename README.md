# **AutonomousCarAI**
## Description

Training a car to drive autonomously. A deep learning implementation of simple self driving car.  The aim of the project is to train a car to drive in a game terrain by capturing the frames and the keys. Each frame has been converted to a *1x900* numpy array corresponds to which there are keys *[w,s,a,d,nokey]*.

## Prerequisites

The python libraries used to capture frames is ***win32api*** which is only available to windows. As an alteranative ***pyscreenshot*** can be used in linux but its extremly slow to capture frames. ***Keras*** with tensorflow backend has been used to train the model.
